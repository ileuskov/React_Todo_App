Hello there! This is a small React.js project I was able to code during the Ninja's React for beginners course

This is an important step for me as I am trying to get into the back end basics.
I decided to learn Node.js since it's quite a popular back end JS environment and it was a good way to upgrade my JS skills as well

The app is made with:
1) HTML, 
2) CSS,
3) JS,
4) Node.js
5) React.js
6) 

The main function of this Todo list app is that instead of just removing or adding a Todo in a li part of the list, it handles the get, post and delete  requests via the Node.js and express. It can add a new Todo by typing it and hitting enter or "Add a Todo" and delete a Todo by clicking on it.

The page is fully responsive and can be read comfortably from any screen. 
Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!

Hello there! This is a small React.js project I was able to code during the Ninja's React for beginners course.

My main goal here was to understand the MVC model and to work with 3 files: App.js, AppTodo.js and Todos.js.
The main functionality is adding and deleting Todos from the dynamic html list. Similar to Node.js Todo App I handle the add and the delete requests via separate files (AddTodo.js and Todos.js) that take care of the Todo array. Those files are then exported to the App.js where they are used to display the todo list dynamically. 

The app is made with:
1) HTML, 
2) CSS,
3) JS,
4) Node.js,
5) and React.js

To start the app you need to have the Node.js. In the terminal just type "npm start" and get to your localhost. The app should be working there.

The page is fully responsive and can be read comfortably from any screen.
